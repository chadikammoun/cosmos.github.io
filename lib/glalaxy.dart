    Text:  'The Milky Way is our home galaxy. It contains over 200 billion stars, including our Sun. The Milky Way has a diameter of about 170,000 or 200,000 light years, and is a barred spiral galaxy. The idea that the Milky Way is made of stars goes back to the Ancient Greek philosopher Democritus. The Milky Way has three main parts: a disk, where the Solar System is, a bulge at the core, and an outer halo all around it. Although the word "disk" suggests it is flat, the Milky Way is actually not quite flat. It is slightly warped and twisted. This galaxy belongs to the Local Group of three large galaxies and over 50 smaller galaxies. The Milky Way is one of the largest galaxies in the group, second to the Andromeda Galaxy. Its closest neighbour is the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, which is about 25,000 light years away from the Earth. The Andromeda Galaxy is moving towards the Milky Way Galaxy, and will collide with it in about 3.75 billion years. The Andromeda Galaxy moves with a speed of about 1,800 kilometres per minute.',

    Text:  'The Andromeda galaxy is the nearest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way, our galaxy. Andromeda is sometimes called Messier 31, M31 or NGC 224 by astronomers. It is about 2.6 million light years away from us. In other words, we see it as it was 2.6 million years ago. The galaxy looks like a dim, fuzzy star to the naked eye: We can only see the central part through a telescope. Andromeda is named after the princess in Greek mythology called Andromeda (Ανδρομέδα). Andromeda is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which consists of the Andromeda galaxy, the Milky Way galaxy, the Triangulum galaxy, and about 30 other smaller galaxies. Although the largest, Andromeda may not be the most massive. Recent findings suggest that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and may be the most massive in the group.',
